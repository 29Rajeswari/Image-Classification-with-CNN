# Image Classification with CNN (CIFAR-10)
 Dataset
1.	Dataset: CIFAR-10
2.	Size: 60,000 color images (32×32 pixels)
3.	Classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck
4.	Split: 50,000 training images, 10,000 testing images

 Processing Steps
1.	Preprocessing: Normalize pixel values to [0, 1]
2.	Model Architecture (Simple CNN)
a)	Conv2D(32, ReLU) → MaxPooling
b)	Conv2D(64, ReLU) → MaxPooling
c)	Flatten → Dense(64, ReLU) → Dense(10, Softmax)
3.	Training Setup
a)	Optimizer: Adam
b)	Loss: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
c)	Metrics: Accuracy
d)	Train/Test Split: 80% / 20%

Performance (10 Epochs)
1.	Test Accuracy: ~70–75%
2.	Observations:
o	Strong on distinct classes (airplane, ship, truck)
o	Misclassifications in similar classes (cat vs dog, automobile vs truck)

Analysis	
1.	CNN captures spatial features like edges, textures, and shapes
2.	Shallow network → struggles with complex patterns
3.	Prediction visualization: green = correct, red = incorrect

Conclusion
1.	Achieved ~70–75% accuracy with a simple 2-layer CNN
2.	Improvements possible with:
a)	Deeper architectures (VGG, Res Net)
b)	Data augmentation
c)	Regularization (Dropout, Batch Norm)
d)	Transfer learning
